intro1: No memory, I open one eye and then two, my head hurts. 
intro2: What am I doing here? Everything is dark around me, the room looks huge. 
intro3: Everything looks familiar but I've never been here. 
I think I'm in a museum. 
intro4: But what happened to this painting? Why is it torn? 
It looks like something is missing. The poor frightened-looking woman, what was going on? 
intro5: Who put her in this state ? All is well...Lucrèce ? 
Strange...maybe she's too shocked to answer me ? 
intro6: Maybe the other works could help me to see more clearly ? 

#transition 

t1: See museum
t2: Go to the first painting

#debut-oeuvre1
o1moi1: Good evening, can you hear me?
o1o1: Of course we can hear you, all paintings have ears.
o1moi2: Why isn't the woman in the painting over there answering me then?
o1o2: Her painting is torn, you can't communicate with each other, time is frozen for her.

#oeuvre1-choix1
o1c1moi3: How long has the painting been torn ?
o1c1o3: The painting has recently been torn up, it was still whole last night.
o1c1moi3.2: Torn? but this woman... she seems to be suffering...
o1c1o3.2: I know that a painting tears when one of the characters escapes from the canvas, but he risks dying and falling into oblivion if he doesn't return to it quickly.

#oeuvre1-choix2
o1c2moi3: Do you know why I'm here ? I don't know where I come from.
o1c2o3: Actually we don't know what you are doing here, the museum is closed. We fell asleep together peacefully last night and nothing disturbed our sleep.
o1c2moi3.2: So you didn't hear anything about this painting then ?
o1c2o3.2: No we didn't see anything and heard nothing, sorry we can't help any more, why these questions ?
o1c2moi3.3: I believe that a woman...this woman Lucretia was attacked last night...
o1c2o3.3: You seem to be very worried about this situation.
o1c2moi3.4: Who wouldn't be? What if it happens again?
o1c2o3.4: Then it will happen again

#oeuvre1-choix3
o1c3moi3: Who the hell are you?
o1c3o3: Who are we? Only two beings, in love with each other. We have been in this painting since 1878, it is Henri GERVEX who imagined us and has been painting ever since, we both live happily, as our painter decided.

#fin-oeuvre1
o1o4: Are you going to find out who committed this offence? 
o1moi4: Yes, I think my mission here is to find out who could have done such a horrible thing. 
o1o5: You should go and see the work next door, there are many of them, perhaps they will know more than the two of us.
o1moi5: Thank you for the information you have given me.

#transition 

t3: See museum
t4: Go to the second painting

#debut-oeuvre2
o2moi1: Excuse me, I was told to come here to talk to you...
o2o1: Let me guess... the two flatterers next door sent you here?
o2moi2: Yes, I came to see you because I'm a little lost... but it seems to be a mess here too. You think...
o2o2: We heard screams and strange noises!
o2o3: That voice... that voice... it was full of fear... 
o2o4: No fear, but worse... horror.
o2o5: Something has happened.
o2o6: Yes, for sure.
o2o7: And who are you?
o2moi3: I don't know, but what is certain is that I have to find out... who... why... how...


#oeuvre2-choix1
o2c1moi4: What happened?
o2c1o8: We heard noises.
o2c1o8.2: And screams too.
o2c1o8.3: But no door noises.
o2c1o8.4: Nothing like that.
o2c1o8.5: At the sound of the tearing the screams fell silent.
o2c1moi4.2: Tearing ? Of the painting ?
o2c1o8.6: Of the painting or of the heart, who knows...
o2c1o8.7: He is still with us.
o2c1moi4.3: But who are you talking about ?
o2c1o8.8: The person who is hurting Lucretia. She hasn't left the museum, we are all sure of that, she hid among us. Find her !

#oeuvre2-choix2
o2c2moi4: Maybe you can help me. Do you know what I'm doing here? 
o2c2o8: How could we know this? We don't even know who you are...
o2c2moi4.2: It's true, I'm not sure I do either...Do you at least know if I'm in a museum?
o2c2o8.2: We are in the Bordeaux Museum of Fine Arts.
o2c2o8.3: We are all upset by what we have heard, we don't know anything more.


#oeuvre2-choix3
o2c3moi4: But why are there so many of you in such a small space?
o2c3o8: We are all gathered for our goddess Venus.
o2c3o8.2: We are here to honour and serve her, so we accompany her on the waters of love.
o2c3o8.3: I'm sure you think I'm old? It seems that I come from antiquity, in reality we are just two and a half centuries old, my sketch dates only from 1760.
o2c3moi4.2: Wise as you are, you must surely know things I don't know?
o2c3o8.4: It goes without saying, I do everything I can to help you.

#fin-oeuvre2
o2moi5: Thank you for your help but I don't know what to do.

#auloin-oeuvre3
o209: Do you want to know where you came from and what happened to the painting? Come closer to me.


#debut-oeuvre3
o3o1: Let me introduce myself. My name is Mr Orsini, I am a senator in Italy. You are asking yourself some significant questions. Where do I come from? Who am I? Where am I going? 
You’re the only one who can answer all these questions. 
o3moi1: Only me? I don't think I should spend time taking care of myself when a famished evil man is wandering among us and may at any moment do worse than he has already done.
o3o2: What would be important to know is that there is never any chance.
o3moi2: What are you saying?
o3o3: Ill-famed or badly led? It would be enough to distinguish one from the other. 

#oeuvre3-choix1
o3c1moi3: How could I do it in such a mixed situation?
o3c1o4: I'm going to put you on a trail...what's important is to find out the truth about your origin. But the pure truth is very rarely pure

#oeuvre3-choix2
o3c2moi3: But who are you, to know more about me than I do?
o3c2o4: I am only a humanist dressed comfortably, camped out in my silent solitude. But unlike you, I ask myself the right questions, and you should do the same.

#fin-oeuvre3
o3o5: A fugitive has disappeared from the painting in which he was painted a merciful yet eternal destiny... but remind me of your question?
o3moi4: I... I don't know anymore... everything is blurred... as if a thick fog was invading me... how did I get here?
o3o6: Why are you here?
o3moi5: I... I... I'm the one who came out of that painting...?  I'm the one who hurt Lucretia! How could I... I didn't think... I can’t be that person!
o3o7: It was the painter who decided for you, like a Greek tragedy, you can't escape your destiny.
o3moi6: How can I repair the harm I've caused?
o3o8: You cannot. However, you only have the ultimate choice, to live and accept or to be forgotten and free... Good luck....
o3moi7: So that's it... that's me... 
o3moi8: What should I do? Go back to my painting and accept the fate that has been assigned to me as all the muses have done? Follow my own destiny by staying outside my frame to perish alone in the oblivion of all and myself? 

#fin-choix1
c1n1: Return to the painting and accept my fate 
c1n2: You have chosen to return to the painting. Your fate painted by Tiziano Vecellio is now forever anchored in the frame of this painting, in full view of all visitors. You are the eternal Tarquin, nobody will forget you as long as you are exposed.

#fin-choix2
c2n1: Sinking into oblivion and eternal solitude
c2n2: You have chosen not to return to the painting.
Gradually, nobody remembers you anymore, not even Lucretia, you saved her, and you saved your image. Unfortunately, you are no longer Tarquin but a lifeless soul wandering around the walls of the museum.
